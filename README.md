##Loan It To Me

A simple app to rent tools from neighbors. The site interface was inspired by airbnb. I use backbone to smooth the transitions between different views and to provide instant search. I use Thoughtbot's excellent [backbone-support](https://github.com/thoughtbot/backbone-support) to unbind events and more cleanly change the views.
