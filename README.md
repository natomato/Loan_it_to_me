## Loan It To Me

A simple app to rent tools from neighbors.
It is designed to be a Single Page App.
The app starts at the Categories Controller serving the index page.
Then the LoanItToMe.js script launches backbone and starts the router.
The categoryIndexView should launch next and display each category.

###Current Progress
Im not sure why the CategoryIndex view will not display a list of categories.
