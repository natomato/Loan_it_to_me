Assets Pipeline
to reference an image inside your app you only need to mention the assets folder. no subfolders, in production all assets are in the same file

ex. <img src="assets/cat.png">

what it does:
concatenates assets
  checkout the applicatino.js file
  all of those named files are pulled into this file
  that is pulled together by sprockets
minifies the file
converts SASS and CoffeeScript to the base languages

also uses
lib/assets :ned never uses this, ok.
vendor/assets :this is where serializeJSON goes

to keep the heroku app alive user ping or some other service
